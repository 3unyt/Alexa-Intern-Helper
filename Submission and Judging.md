**Alexa Skill**

Work with your team to build your Alexa skill. We recommend using the Alexa Developer Portal (https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit) for guidance. Once you’ve created your skill, you’ll use the [Beta Testing Skill](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/skills-beta-testing-for-alexa-skills.html) to share your skill with our judges.

**Presentation**

Your presentation should be approximately five minutes long and address the following questions:

- What does your skill do?
- How will this skill help interns during their pre-onboarding period?
- What makes your skill unique?
- What did you learn while building the skill?
  - store and read data from S3
  - intent chaining
  - handling Yes/NoIntent with multiple questions
  - email sending

The presentation should also show a brief demo of your skill. Record your skill with your team – we recommend Chime’s recording capabilities – and upload it to WorkDocs. You’ll share the link in the submission section of this portal.

### Future improvement:

Maybe we should label the task as IN_PROGRESS and recheck after 7 days, if still not completed, then ask to reach out again.
